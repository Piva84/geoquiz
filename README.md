# GEOQUIZ

This is a small quiz page with geographical topic.

## Features

- This is my idea how it should look like before i started to code

- __The main page__

- Is clean and simple, easy to understand.

### Features for the future

- In the future I want to add some more functions, like name input.

## Testing

I have tested all the html-code with the W3C validator to ensure that the code is correct and there are no errors within it.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- CSS
  - 3 small errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css)

### Unfixed Bugs

- there were no errors that the validators found in the code

## Deployment

This section describes the process I went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform, (GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy I went thru are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - In the navbar to the left click on pages 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
